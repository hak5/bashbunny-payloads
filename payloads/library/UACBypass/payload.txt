# Download and executes any binary executable with administrator privileges WITHOUT

# Please define URL and SAVEFILENAME in the a.vbs script 
# Works on Windows 7 - Windows 10
# The UAC bypass was patched in Win10 V.1607, the file will still execute but with normal user privliges 
# However from what i am aware version 7,8 and 8.1 are still effected 
# Still the fastest download and execute for HID attacks to date.
