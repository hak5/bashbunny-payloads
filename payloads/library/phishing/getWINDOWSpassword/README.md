SIDE NOTE: this is just a prototype and I will make a better one later 

HOW IT WORKS:
It goes into a keyboard and storage.
Then it turns red.
Then it opens powershell via the run command.
Then it closes powershell and makes it run as admin.
Then it says yes to run as admin.
Then it writes down the users. (just in case you dont know what the username is (Ik its irelevant))
Then it writes down the IPs. (so you know what to connect to)
Then it writes down the hashes with SAM and SYSTEM.
DISCLAIMER: this is all wroten down on D:\nothingwashereorwillhappen\ so you need to have a folder with that name on your bash bunny.
If there is more than one storage unit change it. (I know this is not the most ethical way but I am gonna fix that in the next verison.)
Then it exits, minimizes all windows, and the bash bunny disconnects and turns green.

ANOTHER SIDE NOTE: if you want to know how you can use this go to: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L26Xq7m0uQ0&list=PLTnKEBOD8VBgfdK-nMiS3-oLM6gz3OHEx&)
and keep in mind this is for fun not for harm
