# PS-Draw

A script used to generate and draw images in the Powershell Window, used to leave a signature or perhaps taunt victims

## Description

These two programs use two different method to draw out images in the Powershell Window. 
PS-Draw will convert an image you download into a BMP file estiamte the used colors based off the 16 available powershell colors 
then draw your image out in the powershell window. This process is not exact and needed testing of multiple images to find one that works well. 

PS-Custom-Draw generates images to be drawn in the Powershell Window based off pre-configured arrays I put together already included in the file itself. 
These images look significantly cleaner due to the fact they were drawn and coded specifically for this purpose.

After the images are generated, a greeting will be generated by grabbing either the name associated with the registered microsoft account or the 
UserName environment variable. 
The script will then be paused until a mouse movement is detected at which time the pre selected image will be drawn out in the powershell window. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Windows 10,11

### Executing program

* Plug in your Device
* A one liner command in the run box will execute the script on the bash bunny
* The image will be converted into a BMP file
* An algorithm will be used to find the closest matching colors available in the powershell window
* The image will be generated in the powershell window

This is an example of an image I used with the PS-Draw command

This is how the iamge is interpreted and drawn out

* The PS-Custom-Draw operates a little differently 
* One of the preconfigured arrays is piped into the command to generate an image 
 
* "$col | PS-Draw"  - This first one will show the available colors to be used as seen below
