# Replaces the first 69 (heh) sectors on /dev/sda with a custom bootloader and associated payload.
# A backup of the original data is created at /home/username/mbr_backup.bin
# This payload does leverage some code from /library/credentials/SudoBackdoor/injector by oXis.
# That's right, if unmodified, this payload will only work against root warriors!
