# and AddAdminUser.

# Joblist3 is the signature Total P0wn job load.  When ran as non-admin the following scripts will run:
# VaultCredentials, Powercat (Powershell Netcat, requires another machine running Powercat or NCat), SMBExfil.
# If ran as admin then the AddAdminJobsTP will test true to UACBypassed admin and queue up the following jobs:
# Mimidogz, PowerDump, AddAdminUser and SethcBD (Sets a local backdoor for even locked machines when you hit SHIFT
