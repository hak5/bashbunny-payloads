Through this script you will be able to change windows user's password super fast.

**Category**: Execution

## Description

Through this script you will be able to change windows user's password super fast.

A PowerShell with administrator permissions is started, and through the use of the `net` command you can change the password without necessarily having to know the original password.

It is always very fascinating to see how many things you can do on Windows systems without needing to know the original password. As fascinating as it is disturbing.

## Dependencies

* Nothing (i know it's absurd)

## Settings

You must define the new Windows user password.

```shell
NEW_PASSWORD='example'
```
