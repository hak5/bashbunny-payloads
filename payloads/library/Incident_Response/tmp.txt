Shouldn't the "incident response" folder have lowercase initials instead of capital letters?

This can be seen from both the other repositories and the link that can be created from the Hak5 site -> Contribute section.

This difference does not allow users to upload payloads directly from the Hak5 site since the "incident_response" folder does not exist since "Incident_Response" exists.
