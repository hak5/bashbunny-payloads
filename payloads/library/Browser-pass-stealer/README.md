This allows you to get passwords from browers within seconds!
This is my very first payload and I have tested it on the new bash bunny and so far it works without a problem
There is few thing you need though in order to have this payload working 1 you need the name your bash bunny uf
so that the passwords get saved to the correct place. 
2 You need to put the s.exe(very important that you keep it that name) in the home directory of the bash bunny
The payload must be in switch 1 or switch 2 but the s.exe software must be put in the home directory

Well that is it. Thanks Darren Kitchen and Shannon Morese for all of the youtube videos. :) very helpful.
