## Description
Showing a user friendly way to reference colours, BLUE,GREEN,CYAN,RED,PURPLE,YELLOW,WHITE,BLACK

will produce each of the 8 colours on the led via a user friendly name that is instantly reconisable when reading sourcecode.

BLUE, GREEN, Cyan, RED, Purple, Yellow, White, BLACK

My Hope is if this example is usefull for others than I or someone else can write a libary to extend the current LED libary.
