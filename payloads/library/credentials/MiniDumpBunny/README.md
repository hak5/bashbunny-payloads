What is MiniDumpBunny?
#
*MiniDumpBunny uses Powersploits Out-MiniDump script to dump lsass. The script was rewritten, adapted for BashBunny usage and obfuscated in multiple ways to evade Antivirus.*
#

**Instruction:**

Plug in your BashBunny equipped with the obfuscated MiniBunny.bat file, wait a few seconds, go away.
#
Exfiltrate the .dmp file and read it with Mimikatz.
