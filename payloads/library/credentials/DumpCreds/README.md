# Problems
- if you use the payload on a computer th efirst time, it will take some time and tries until the drivers are successfully loaded.
- If the payload doesnt work. (Red LED or Yellow LED blinks 2 or 4 times) plug off the BB  and try it once more (can take 3 or 4 times)
- If the payload stops working yellow LED blinks very fast or triples longer than 2min. You get no white LED. Your run into a time out. 
  If you plugin the BB every payload has 1min 30sfor doing the job. At 1min 30s every payload stops. (Thats a FW 1.1 issue)  
- Don't us a static IP adress for the Target_Host (GET TARGET_IP will only work with DHCP)
