# ExecutableInstaller for Bash Bunnys

* Author: PCnurse
* Version: Version 1.0
* Target: Windows

## Description

Will run MrGraysRubberHack via powershell and save to the BashBuny. Total time from inserting the Bunny into the computer and removal is about 15-20 seconds.

## Configuration

To set up your BashBunny for use you will place the Payload and ducky_script into a Switch folder. You will then place
the grabNgo folder (which has the MrGraysRubberHack folder, d, e and i files in it) into the the payload folder. 
You will need to make sure that your target computer is an admin user for this to run without issue. 
I have only tested on windows 10 machine so far. Will be testing more in the next week or so. Enjoy and of course how this is used is not on me. 
Passwords will be saved as TXT files under grabNgo/grabbedpasswords,
MrGraysRubberHack information can be found here.
