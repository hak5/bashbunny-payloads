# Title: AutoScreenshot Windows
# Author: Nick Rau
# Credits to: guitarrapc for the Get-Screenshot.ps1
# Category: Prank
# Target: Windows
# Attackmodes: Hid, Storage
# Description:	This payload does uses powershell to take a screenshot of what's displayed on your desktop and
#		saves it to the Bash Bunny. It makes use of a pre-made powershell script made by guitarrapc so
#		credits for the Get-ScreenShot.ps1 go to him. I altered the script a bit to get around the problem
#		with the 1920x1080 resolution. If you have part of your screen saved than you can fill in the resolution
#		in the ... variables. EXAMPLE: 1920, 1080 or "null" if you do not want to use it.

###### DISCLAMER #######
# Do not use the keyboard when this payload runs.
# The bunny comes up on screen when it is plugged in but it automaticly puts it
# on the background using Ducky Script.

###### OPTIONS ######
# The options have to be set in the powershell file Get-ScreenShot.ps1.
# The variable is called $fillres and is on top of the script.
#
# Fill it in like this: 				$fillres = 1920, 1080
# Or if you do not want to fill in the resolution:	$fillres = "null"

###### CONFIGURATION ######
# 1. Put Get-ScreenShot.ps1 in the root folder of the Bash Bunny.
# 2. Set variable "$fillres" to resolution of your choice example:1920, 1080 or "null"
# 3. Eject Bash Bunny, set to switch you chose and plug it in.
# 4. When the second stage begins "LED SPECIAL" it is waiting for you to set everything ready
#    to be shot. This will be a blue blinking light When ready leave the Bash Bunny plugged in
#    and flip switch to a different position.
# 5. Bash Bunny takes screenshot and saves it!
