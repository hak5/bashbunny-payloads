Tools Installer for Bash Bunny
Version 1.1.0

Moves tools from the tools_to_install/ USB disk to /pentest (at the root directory) on the Bash Bunny
When installation succeeds, install.sh will be renamed to install.sh.INSTALLED

*First Time Users* We recommend to run GitBunnyGit or clone the github repository to the Bash Bunny 
to get up to date payloads before running Tools Installer

A list of installed tools is created on the USB disk as installed-tools.txt
