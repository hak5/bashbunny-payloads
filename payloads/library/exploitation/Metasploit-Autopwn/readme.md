# Metasploit-Autopwn

* Author: Mohamed A. Baset - @SymbianSyMoh - Seekurity.com
* Version: Version 0.1
* Target: Windows

## Description:

Runs Metasploit db_autopwn module against the whole dhcp clients conencted to the Bash Bunny device exploiting locked and unlocked machines that running vulnerable OSes or services.

## Configuration/Prequisities:

1. Ruby 2.4.1 installed via 'rbenv' (the best to have ruby installed without any problems)
2. You must have metasploit installation up and running in path /toos/metasploit-framework/
3. Copy auto_pwn.rc metasploit resources file from the payload folder to /tools/ by SSHing into your bunny
4. One-time fix for adding user "postgres" to the network user groups (should be done by HAK5 folks in the first place)


## Notes

This was designed and tested on a Netgear Nighthawk Router, and an Arris Xfinity Modem/Router combo; however
I don't see why it couldn't be used for any internet connected device that uses basic http authentication.
And please... Don't feed the bunnies.
