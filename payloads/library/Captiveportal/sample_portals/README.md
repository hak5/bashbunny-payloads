## What? Why?

This repository is a collection of captive portals from around the world.
The reason for the respository is to assist in phishing and Hak5 Pineapple attacks.

## How to contribute

Are you somewhere with a captive portal? Take a snapshot of it with the following command:

`wget -E -H -k -K -p http://192.168.1.1/`

Source of wget command: http://debugfix.com/2011/11/properly-mirror-webpage-using-wget/

Once you have it, zip, tar or package it up and shoot it over to mubix@hak5.org for inclusion
into the repository. Or feel free to create a pull request as you choose.
